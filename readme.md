#This is a Laravel4 web application that I was working on for a friend. Web application is no longer available on the domain I had it, so I took it down. The application is built with a modern PHP MVC Framework. Some of the things I learned while working on this project were how to implement features such as a Datepicker with Jquery, and a Pagination feature for the records being displayed.
