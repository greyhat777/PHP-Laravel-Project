                        <h4>Team UP * Negotiate * Obtain * Save</h4>
                        <ul>
                        	<li>First, pick a region you would like to view groups(cartels) in.</li><br/>
                        	<li>Second, join a group that wants to do what you want to do, or create a group
                        		that you would like to create. IMPORTANT! do not duplicate groups it decreases
                        		and dilutes everyones purchasing power. Only create a group when it is absolutely
                        		necessary because you can't find an elgible group.</li><br/>
                        	<li>
                        		Third, meet up somewhere safe and public, try to not go alone or take cash or valuables,
                        		agree on a store or merchant to visit or meet directly there to begin with and agree on general 
                        		acceptable goals you wish to accomplish. 
                        	</li><br/>
                        	<li>
                        		Fourth, agree on a person or two to communicate your request to speak to the appropriate person at the
                        		 store (usually the manager). Try to not be a control freak or get all frustrated. Be a mature adult if
                        		 you completely disagree just speak to the mangager or sales person yourself or create our own group and just 
                        		 return another time... remain calm and chill at all times. The power in numbers alone is good enough to get you 
                        		 an amazing discount you otherwise wouldn't have access to anyways. 
                        	</li><br/>
                        	<li>
                        		Fifth, have fun and save $$$. P.S. always remember to support local shops!
